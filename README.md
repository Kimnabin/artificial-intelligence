# AI learning journey

Welcome to this repository!  This is a place to store all materials, tasks, projects and notes related to the artificial intelligence (AI) learning process.  It includes both the knowledge learned in university classes and the discoveries obtained in the personal learning process.

## target

This repository is made with the following goals:

*** Knowledge storage and systemization: ** Easily track the progress of learning and help you to review your knowledge when needed.
*** Knowledge sharing: ** It can help others, especially beginners.
*** Portfolio construction: ** Shows the skills and knowledge acquired in the field of AI.

## detail

This repository is configured as follows:

** `Week1/`: ** (This folder includes the contents of the class lecture)
    * `Week 1 -Introduction to AI/`: ​​(Example: Lecture 1 -AI Introduction)

***`Week2/`: ** (This folder includes the contents of the class lecture)
    * `Week 2- /`: (Example: week 2 -AI Introduction, KNN-알고리즘, KNN모뎉 활용방법), 데이터를 로컬 불러오기, 웹주소에 불러오기, 데이터를 분할 + 이상치 제거...
